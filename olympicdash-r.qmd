## Dashboard

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "", 
       title = "Highway Milage (mpg) for Different Car Manufacturers"
       )
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
